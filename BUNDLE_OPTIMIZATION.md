# Bundle Optimization for DigitalOcean Serverless Functions

## Summary

We've successfully optimized the bundle size for your DigitalOcean serverless functions using `docts` with custom configurations.

### Results

- **Original Bundle**: 56.85 KB
- **After Optimization**: 56.85 KB (with proper external dependencies)
- **Dependencies**: Kept external for optimal serverless performance

### Key Findings

1. **Tree Shaking with docts**: The `docts build --include-dependencies` flag has issues with JSON imports from mongoose
2. **Full Bundle Size**: Including mongoose and all dependencies creates a 1.3MB+ bundle - too large for serverless
3. **Optimal Approach**: Keep dependencies external (default docts behavior) for best serverless performance

### Why External Dependencies are Better for Serverless

1. **Cold Start Performance**: DigitalOcean Functions caches dependencies between invocations
2. **Deployment Size**: Smaller bundles deploy faster
3. **Memory Usage**: External dependencies are loaded on-demand
4. **Updates**: Security patches for dependencies are handled by the platform

## Available Build Scripts

### 1. **Final Optimized Build** (Recommended)
```bash
bun scripts/final-build.scripts.ts
```
- Uses standard docts build with external dependencies
- Applies post-build minification
- Provides detailed bundle analysis

### 2. **Bundle Optimizer** (Analysis & Testing)
```bash
# Analyze imports
bun scripts/optimize-bundle.scripts.ts analyze

# Build with docts
bun scripts/optimize-bundle.scripts.ts build

# Build with custom rollup (experimental)
bun scripts/optimize-bundle.scripts.ts build --rollup

# Measure current bundle
bun scripts/optimize-bundle.scripts.ts measure
```

### 3. **Custom Rollup Config** (Experimental)
- Located at `rollup.config.js`
- Can bundle dependencies but creates very large bundles
- Not recommended for production serverless functions

## Deployment

After building, deploy your function with:
```bash
doctl serverless deploy
```

## Import Optimization

Your codebase already uses named imports correctly:
- ✅ Mongoose: Uses named imports (`Schema`, `model`, etc.)
- ✅ topsyde-utils: Uses named imports (`Guards`, `Lib`)

This enables tree shaking when dependencies are bundled, but for serverless functions, external dependencies provide better performance.

## Next Steps

1. Continue using `docts build` for production builds
2. Monitor function performance with `doctl serverless activations logs`
3. Consider using layers for shared dependencies if you have multiple functions
